Unit 4: Multidimensional Association Rules


4.1 Multidimensional Association Rules
    Extension of single-dimensional association rules.
    Uses multiple attributes (dimensions) at the same time.
    Each dimension represents a different feature of the dataset.
    Finds patterns involving more than one attribute.
    Example:
        Single-dimensional  : {Milk} → {Bread}
        Multidimensional    : {Milk in Store A, Age 20-30} → {Bread, Gender = Male}
    Useful in data warehouses with fact and dimension tables.
    Involves selecting relevant dimensions and finding frequent patterns.
    Support and confidence are calculated across multiple attributes.
    Helps in decision making, marketing, and customer behavior analysis.
