Question 1: Static Discretization

    Question:
        A retail store collected data of 6 customers with their Age, Income (in K), and Product Bought:

        | Customer | Age | Income (K) | Product Bought |
        |----------|-----|------------|----------------|
        | C1       | 22  | 35         | Laptop         |
        | C2       | 28  | 42         | Laptop         |
        | C3       | 34  | 38         | Printer        |
        | C4       | 45  | 50         | Laptop         |

        | C6       | 25  | 40         | Laptop         |

        Tasks:
            1. Discretize Age into ranges: 21-30, 31-40, 41-50
            2. Discretize Income into ranges: 31-40K, 41-50K
            3. Find frequent itemsets with support ≥ 50%
            4. Generate association rules Age → Product and Income → Product
            5. Calculate confidence for each rule

    Solution:

        Step 1: Discretize numeric attributes

            | Customer | Age Range | Income Range | Product Bought |
            |----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
            | C1       | 21-30     | 31-40        | Laptop         |
            | C2       | 21-30     | 41-50        | Laptop         |
            | C3       | 31-40     | 31-40        | Printer        |
            | C4       | 41-50     | 41-50        | Laptop         |
            | C5       | 21-30     | 41-50        | Printer        |
            | C6       | 21-30     | 31-40        | Laptop         |

        Step 2: Frequent itemsets (Support ≥ 50%)

            Age Ranges:
                20-30 → 4/6 = 66.7% (accept)
                31-40 → 1/6 = 16.7% 
                41-50 → 1/6 = 16.7% 

            Income Ranges:
                30-40 → 3/6 = 50% (accept)
                41-50 → 4/6 = 66.7% (accept)

            Products:
                Laptop → 4/6 = 66.7% (accept)
                Printer → 2/6 = 33.3% 

        Step 3: Generate rules and calculate confidence

            Rule 1: Age 20-30 ⇒ Laptop
                    Confidence = 3/4 = 75%

            Rule 2: Income 41-50 ⇒ Laptop
                    Confidence = 2/4 = 50%

            Rule 3: Age 20-30 ∧ Income 30-40 ⇒ Laptop
                Support(Age 20-30 ∧ Income 30-40) = 2/6 = 33.33% (reject)
                Age 20-30 ∧ Income 30-40 ⇒ Laptop (reject)

            3. Find frequent itemsets with support ≥ 50%.
            4. Generate association rules combining Age cluster and Income cluster → Product.
            5. Calculate confidence and interpret the rules.

    Solution:

        Step 1: Dynamic discretization 

            Age Clusters:
                22-27 → C1, C6, C8
                28-38 → C2, C3, C5, C7
                45    → C4

            Income Clusters:
                35-40 → C1, C3, C6, C7
                41-50 → C2, C4, C5, C8

        Step 2: Transform data into clusters

            | Customer | Age Cluster| Income Cluster | Product Bought |
            |----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
            | C1       | 22-27      | 35-40          | Laptop         |
            | C2       | 28-38      | 41-50          | Laptop         |
            | C3       | 28-38      | 35-40          | Printer        |
            | C4       | 45         | 41-50          | Laptop         |
            | C5       | 28-38      | 41-50          | Printer        |
            | C6       | 22-27      | 35-40          | Laptop         |
            | C7       | 28-38      | 35-40          | Printer        |
            | C8       | 22-27      | 41-50          | Laptop         |

        Step 3: Frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%)

            Age 22-27 → 3/8 = 37.5% reject
            Age 28-38 → 4/8 = 50% accept
            Age 45 → 1/8 = 12.5% reject

            Income 35-40 → 4/8 = 50% accept
            Income 41-50 → 4/8 = 50% accept

            Product Laptop → 5/8 = 62.5% accept
            Product Printer → 3/8 = 37.5% reject

        Step 4: Generate rules and calculate confidence

            Rule 1: Age 28-38 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in Age 28-38 = 4 (C2, C3, C5, C7)
                    Laptop bought = 1 (C2)
                    Confidence = 1/4 = 25%

            Rule 2: Age 28-38 ⇒ Printer
                    Customers in Age 28-38 = 4
                    Printer bought = 3 (C3, C5, C7)
                    Confidence = 3/4 = 75% accept(but, this is not allowed. why?)

            Rule 3: Income 41-50 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in Income 41-50 = 4 (C2, C4, C5, C8)
                    Laptop bought = 3 (C2, C4, C8)
                    Confidence = 3/4 = 75% accept

            Rule 4: Income 41-50 ⇒ Printer
                    Customers in Income 41-50 = 4
                    Printer bought = 1 (C5)
                    Confidence = 1/4 = 25% reject

            Rule 5: Age 22-27 ∧ Income 35-40 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in Age 22-27 ∧ Income 35-40 = 2 (C1, C6)
                    Laptop bought = 2
                    Confidence = 2/2 = 100% accept(but, this is not allowed. why?)

            Rule 6: Age 22-27 ∧ Income 41-50 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in Age 22-27 ∧ Income 41-50 = 1 (C8)
                    Laptop bought = 1
                    Confidence = 1/1 = 100% accept(but, this is not allowed. why?)

            5. Calculate confidence and interpret the rules.


    Solution:

        Step 1: Distance-based clustering (k=3 for both Age and Income)

            Age Clusters:
                Cluster A1: 22-27 → C1, C6, C8, C10
                Cluster A2: 28-34 → C2, C3, C5, C9
                Cluster A3: 38-45 → C4, C7

            Income Clusters:
                Cluster I1: 35-39 → C1, C3, C6, C7, C10
                Cluster I2: 40-45 → C2, C5, C8, C9
                Cluster I3: 50 → C4

        Step 2: Transform data into clusters

            | Customer | Age Cluster| Income Cluster | Product Bought |
            |----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
            | C1       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C2       | A2         | I2             | Laptop         |
            | C3       | A2         | I1             | Printer        |
            | C4       | A3         | I3             | Laptop         |
            | C5       | A2         | I2             | Printer        |
            | C6       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |

            | C10      | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |

        Step 3: Frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%)

            Age Cluster A1 → 4/10 = 40% reject
            Age Cluster A2 → 4/10 = 40% reject
            Age Cluster A3 → 2/10 = 20% reject

            Income Cluster I1 → 5/10 = 50% accept
            Income Cluster I2 → 4/10 = 40% reject
            Income Cluster I3 → 1/10 = 10% reject

            Product Laptop → 5/10 = 50% accept
            Product Printer → 5/10 = 50% accept

        Step 4: Generate rules and calculate confidence

            Rule 1: Income Cluster I1 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in I1 = 5 (C1, C3, C6, C7, C10)
                    Laptop bought = 3 (C1, C6, C10)
                    Confidence = 3/5 = 60% accept

            Rule 2: Age Cluster A1 ∧ Income Cluster I1 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in A1 ∧ I1 = 3 (C1, C6, C10)
                    Laptop bought = 3
                    Confidence = 3/3 = 100% accept (but, this is not allowed. why?)

            Rule 3: Age Cluster A2 ∧ Income Cluster I2 ⇒ Printer
                    Customers in A2 ∧ I2 = 3 (C2, C5, C9)
                    Printer bought = 2 (C5, C9)
                    Confidence = 2/3 ≈ 66.7% accept((but, this is not allowed. why?))

            Rule 4: Age Cluster A3 ∧ Income Cluster I3 ⇒ Laptop
                    Customers in A3 ∧ I3 = 1 (C4)
                    Laptop bought = 1
                    Confidence = 1/1 = 100% accept((but, this is not allowed. why?))

            From the following dataset of 8 customers with Age, Income, and Product purchased, 
            perform association mining and correlation analysis. Generate rules, calculate support, 
            confidence, and lift. Decide whether to accept or reject the rules.

            | Customer | Age | Income | Product |
            |----------|-----|--------|---------|
            | C1       | 22  | 35     | Laptop  |
            | C2       | 28  | 42     | Laptop  |
            | C3       | 34  | 38     | Printer |
            | C4       | 45  | 50     | Laptop  |
            | C5       | 30  | 45     | Printer |
            | C6       | 25  | 40     | Laptop  |
            | C7       | 38  | 37     | Printer |
            | C8       | 27  | 41     | Laptop  |


    Solution:

        Step 1: Discretize numeric attributes into clusters for Age and Income

            - Age clusters:
                - A1: 22-27 → C1, C6, C8
                - A2: 28-38 → C2, C3, C5, C7
                - A3: 45 → C4
            - Income clusters:
                - I1: 35-40 → C1, C3, C6, C7
                - I2: 41-50 → C2, C4, C5, C8

        Step 2: Transform numeric data into cluster labels

            | Customer | Age Cluster | Income Cluster | Product |
            |----------|------------|----------------|---------|
            | C1       | A1         | I1             | Laptop  |
            | C2       | A2         | I2             | Laptop  |
            | C3       | A2         | I1             | Printer |
            | C4       | A3         | I2             | Laptop  |
            | C5       | A2         | I2             | Printer |
            | C6       | A1         | I1             | Laptop  |
            | C7       | A2         | I1             | Printer |
            | C8       | A1         | I2             | Laptop  |

        Step 3: Find frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%)

            - Age A1 → 3/8 = 37.5% reject  
            - Age A2 → 4/8 = 50% accept  
            - Age A3 → 1/8 = 12.5% reject  
            - Income I1 → 4/8 = 50% accept  
            - Income I2 → 4/8 = 50% accept  
            - Product Laptop → 5/8 = 62.5% accept  
            - Product Printer → 3/8 = 37.5% reject  

        Step 4: Generate association rules and calculate confidence

            Rule 1: Age A1 ∧ Income I1 ⇒ Laptop  
                    - Customers in A1 ∧ I1 = C1, C6  
                    - Laptop bought = 2  
                    - Confidence = 2/2 = 100%  

            Rule 2: Age A1 ∧ Income I2 ⇒ Laptop  
                    - Customers in A1 ∧ I2 = C8  
                    - Laptop bought = 1  
                    - Confidence = 1/1 = 100%  

            Rule 3: Age A2 ∧ Income I1 ⇒ Printer  
                    - Customers in A2 ∧ I1 = C3, C7  
                    - Printer bought = 2  
                    - Confidence = 2/2 = 100%  

            Rule 4: Age A2 ∧ Income I2 ⇒ Printer  
                    - Customers in A2 ∧ I2 = C5  
                    - Printer bought = 1  
                    - Confidence = 1/1 = 100%  

            Rule 5: Age A2 ∧ Income I2 ⇒ Laptop  
                    - Customers in A2 ∧ I2 = C2  
                    - Laptop bought = 1  
                    - Confidence = 1/1 = 100%  

            Rule 6: Age A3 ∧ Income I2 ⇒ Laptop  
                    - Customers in A3 ∧ I2 = C4  
                    - Laptop bought = 1  
                    - Confidence = 1/1 = 100%  

            Step 5: Compute lift for each rule

                    - Probability(Laptop overall) = 5/8 = 0.625  
                    - Probability(Printer overall) = 3/8 = 0.375  

        Lift calculations:
            - Rule 1: Lift = 1 / 0.625 = 1.6 → Positive correlation → accept  
            - Rule 2: Lift = 1 / 0.625 = 1.6 → Positive correlation → accept  
            - Rule 3: Lift = 1 / 0.375 = 2.66 → Positive correlation → accept  
            - Rule 4: Lift = 1 / 0.375 = 2.66 → Positive correlation → accept  
            - Rule 5: Lift = 1 / 0.625 = 1.6 → Positive correlation → accept  
            - Rule 6: Lift = 1 / 0.625 = 1.6 → Positive correlation → accept  


Question 5 (Distance-Based / Clustering Method)

            A retail store collected data of 12 customers with Age, Income (in K), and Product Bought:

            | Customer | Age | Income (K) | Product Bought |
            |----------|-----|------------|----------------|
            | C1       | 22  | 36         | Laptop         |
            | C2       | 23  | 37         | Laptop         |
            | C3       | 24  | 36         | Laptop         |
            | C4       | 26  | 38         | Laptop         |
            | C5       | 28  | 42         | Printer        |
            | C6       | 29  | 43         | Printer        |
            | C7       | 30  | 42         | Printer        |
            | C8       | 32  | 44         | Printer        |
            | C9       | 22  | 36         | Laptop         |
            | C10      | 23  | 37         | Laptop         |
            | C11      | 24  | 36         | Laptop         |
            | C12      | 26  | 38         | Laptop         |

        Tasks:

            1. Perform Distance-Based Clustering for Age and Income.
            2. Transform numeric data into cluster labels.
            3. Find frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%).
            4. Generate 3-column rule: Age Cluster ∧ Income Cluster → Product.
            5. Calculate confidence and interpret the rule.

    Solution:

        Step 1: Distance-Based Clustering

            Age Clusters (k=2):
            - A1 (22–26) → C1, C2, C3, C4, C9, C10, C11, C12
            - A2 (28–32) → C5, C6, C7, C8

            Income Clusters (k=2):
            - I1 (36–38) → C1, C2, C3, C4, C9, C10, C11, C12
            - I2 (42–44) → C5, C6, C7, C8

        Step 2: Transform Data into Clusters

            | Customer | Age Cluster | Income Cluster | Product Bought |
            |----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
            | C1       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C2       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C3       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C4       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C5       | A2         | I2             | Printer        |
            | C6       | A2         | I2             | Printer        |
            | C7       | A2         | I2             | Printer        |
            | C8       | A2         | I2             | Printer        |
            | C9       | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C10      | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C11      | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |
            | C12      | A1         | I1             | Laptop         |

        Step 3: Frequent Itemsets (Support ≥50%)

            - Age Clusters:
                - A1 → 8/12 = 66.7% accept
                - A2 → 4/12 = 33.3% reject

            - Income Clusters:
                - I1 → 8/12 = 66.7% accept
                - I2 → 4/12 = 33.3% reject

            - Products:
                - Laptop → 8/12 = 66.7% accept
                - Printer → 4/12 = 33.3% reject

        Step 4: Generate 3-Column Rule (Age ∧ Income → Product)

            Rule: A1 ∧ I1 → Laptop
            - Customers matching A1 ∧ I1 → C1, C2, C3, C4, C9, C10, C11, C12
            - Laptop bought = 8
            - Support = 8/12 = 66.7% accept
            - Confidence = 8/8 = 100% accept

        Step 5: Interpretation

            1. Cluster A1 (Age 22–26) and I1 (Income 36–38) perfectly predicts Laptop.
            2. Both support (66.7%) and confidence (100%) satisfy the minimum support criterion.
            3. This is a valid 3-column rule generated using Distance-Based Clustering.





Question 6(Association Mining to Correlation Analysis): 
        
        Here is the dataset of 5 employees:

        | Employee | Department | Experience (years) | Salary (k) | Bonus |
        |----------|------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
        | E1       | Sales      | 2                | 35        | Yes   |
        | E2       | HR         | 5                | 45        | No    |
        | E3       | Sales      | 3                | 38        | Yes   |
        | E4       | IT         | 6                | 50        | No    |
        | E5       | Sales      | 4                | 40        | Yes   |

        Perform association mining and correlation analysis. 
        Use thresholds: min_sup = 50%, min_conf = 70%. 
        Generate rules, calculate support, confidence, lift, and determine accept/reject.

    Solution:

        Step 1: Discretize numeric attributes
            - Experience clusters:
            - Exp1: 2-3 years → E1, E3
            - Exp2: 4-6 years → E2, E4, E5
            - Salary clusters:
            - Sal1: 35-40k → E1, E3, E5
            - Sal2: 45-50k → E2, E4

        Step 2: Transform dataset into clusters

            | Employee | Department | Exp Cluster | Sal Cluster | Bonus |
            |----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
            | E1       | Sales      | Exp1        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E2       | HR         | Exp2        | Sal2        | No    |
            | E3       | Sales      | Exp1        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E4       | IT         | Exp2        | Sal2        | No    |
            | E5       | Sales      | Exp2        | Sal1        | Yes   |

        Step 3: Find frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%)

            - Department Sales → 3/5 = 60% → pass  
            - Exp1 → 2/5 = 40% → fail  
            - Exp2 → 3/5 = 60% → pass  
            - Sal1 → 3/5 = 60% → pass  
            - Sal2 → 2/5 = 40% → fail  
            - Bonus Yes → 3/5 = 60% → pass  
            - Bonus No → 2/5 = 40% → fail  

        Step 4: Generate candidate association rules

            Rule 1: Department Sales ∧ Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E1, E3, E5 → 3  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E1, E3, E5 → 3  
                - Support = 3/5 = 60%  
                - Confidence = 3/3 = 100%  
                - Both support ≥ 50% and confidence ≥ 70% → Accept 

            Rule 2: Exp2 ∧ Sal2 ⇒ Bonus No  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E2, E4 → 2  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E2, E4 → 2  
                - Support = 2/5 = 40% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 3: Exp1 ∧ Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E1, E3 → 2  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E1, E3 → 2  
                - Support = 2/5 = 40% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 4: Department HR ∧ Sal2 ⇒ Bonus No  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E2 → 1  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E2 → 1  
                - Support = 1/5 = 20% → below min_sup → Reject  

        Step 5: Compute lift for accepted rules(Rule 1: Department Sales ∧ Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes)
            - Probability(Bonus Yes overall) = 3/5 = 0.6  
            - Rule 1: Lift = Confidence / Probability(Bonus Yes) 
                           = 1 / 0.6 
                           ≈ 1.67 → Positive correlation → Accept  

        Step 6: Interpretation

        - Only Rule 1 is accepted because it satisfies both min_sup and min_conf.  
        - Lift > 1 shows a strong positive correlation between Sales ∧ Sal1 and Bonus Yes.  


Question 7 (Association Mining to Correlation Analysis)

        Here is the dataset of 8 employees:

        | Employee  | Department | Experience (years)| Salary (k) | Bonus |
        |-----------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
        | E1        | Sales      | 2                 | 35         | Yes   |
        | E2        | HR         | 5                 | 45         | No    |
        | E3        | Sales      | 3                 | 38         | Yes   |
        | E4        | IT         | 6                 | 50         | No    |
        | E5        | Sales      | 4                 | 40         | Yes   |
        | E6        | IT         | 3                 | 37         | Yes   |
        | E7        | HR         | 4                 | 42         | No    |
        | E8        | Sales      | 5                 | 48         | Yes   |

        Perform association mining and correlation analysis. 
        Use thresholds: min_sup = 50%, min_conf = 70%. 
        Generate rules, calculate support, confidence, lift, and determine accept/reject.

    Solution:

        Step 1: Discretize numeric attributes
            - Experience clusters:
            Exp1: 2–3 years → E1, E3, E6  
            Exp2: 4–6 years → E2, E4, E5, E7, E8

            - Salary clusters:
            Sal1: 35–40k → E1, E3, E5, E6  
            Sal2: 42–50k → E2, E4, E7, E8

        Step 2: Transform dataset into clusters
            | Employee  | Department | Exp Cluster | Sal Cluster | Bonus |
            |-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
            | E1        | Sales      | Exp1        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E2        | HR         | Exp2        | Sal2        | No    |
            | E3        | Sales      | Exp1        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E4        | IT         | Exp2        | Sal2        | No    |
            | E5        | Sales      | Exp2        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E6        | IT         | Exp1        | Sal1        | Yes   |
            | E7        | HR         | Exp2        | Sal2        | No    |
            | E8        | Sales      | Exp2        | Sal2        | Yes   |


        Step 3: Find frequent itemsets (support ≥ 50%)
            - Department Sales → 4/8 = 50% → pass  
            - Department IT → 2/8 = 25% → fail  
            - Department HR → 2/8 = 25% → fail  
            - Exp1 → 3/8 = 37.5% → fail  
            - Exp2 → 5/8 = 62.5% → pass  
            - Sal1 → 4/8 = 50% → pass  
            - Sal2 → 4/8 = 50% → pass  
            - Bonus Yes → 5/8 = 62.5% → pass  
            - Bonus No → 3/8 = 37.5% → fail  


        Step 4: Generate candidate association rules

            Rule 1: Department Sales ∧ Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E1, E3, E5 → 3  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E1, E3, E5 → 3  
                - Support = 3/8 = 37.5% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 2: Department Sales ∧ Sal2 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E8 → 1  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E8 → 1  
                - Support = 1/8 = 12.5% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 3: Exp2 ∧ Sal2 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E8 → 1  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E2, E4, E7, E8 → 4  
                - Support = 1/8 = 12.5% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 4: Exp1 ∧ Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E1, E3, E6 → 3  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E1, E3, E6 → 3  
                - Support = 3/8 = 37.5% → below min_sup → Reject  

            Rule 5: Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes  
                - Records satisfying IF+THEN = E1, E3, E5, E6 → 4  
                - Records satisfying IF only = E1, E3, E5, E6 → 4  
                - Support = 4/8 = 50%  
                - Confidence = 4/4 = 100%  
                - Both support ≥ 50% and confidence ≥ 70% → Accept 

            Rule 6: (Dear students compute more rules by yourself) like:
                -Sales --> bonus yes.
                -sal2 --> bonus yes 


        Step 5: Compute lift for accepted rule
            - Probability(Bonus Yes overall) = 5/8 = 0.625  
            - Rule 5: Lift = Confidence / Probability(Bonus Yes)  
                        = 1 / 0.625  
                        = 1.6 → Positive correlation → Accept  

        Step 6: Interpretation
            - Only Rule 5 (Sal1 ⇒ Bonus Yes) is accepted.  
            - It satisfies both min_sup and min_conf.  
            - Lift > 1 indicates a strong positive correlation between Salary (35–40k) and Bonus = Yes.
