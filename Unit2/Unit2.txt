Unit 2 : Data Warehouse and OLAP Technology


1. Data Warehouse Architecture
    A data warehouse is a centralized system for storing clean, organized, and 
        integrated data from multiple sources.
    It is designed for analysis and decision-making, not daily transaction processing.
    Main Components:
        Data Sources – Operational databases, spreadsheets, APIs, external data.
        ETL Process – Extract (collect), Transform (clean & format), Load (store) data.
        Data Storage – Relational or multidimensional warehouse database.
        Metadata – Describes structure, source, and meaning of the stored data.
        OLAP Tools – Used for fast queries, data exploration, and reporting.
    Benefits:
        Consistent, accurate data for decision-making.
        Historical + current data for trend analysis.
        Handles complex queries faster than normal databases.


2. Steps for the Design and Construction of a Data Warehouse
    Step 1 – Define Business Requirements
        Identify what problems the warehouse will solve (e.g., sales trends, customer segmentation).
        Involve stakeholders – business teams, IT staff, analysts.
        Make sure the design matches business goals.
    Step 2 – Design the Data Warehouse Architecture
        Consider scalability, cost, and security before deciding.
        Choose the type based on needs:
            Centralized – One large warehouse for the entire organization.
            Data Marts – Smaller, department-focused warehouses.
            Data Lake – Stores raw, unstructured data.
            Cloud Warehouse – Like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.
    Step 3 – Select Technology Stack
        Database – Choose based on data size and query needs.
        ETL Tools – Talend, Apache NiFi, Hevo, etc.
    Step 4 – Data Integration & ETL Development
        Gather data from CRM, sales, and external APIs.
        Automate ETL for real-time or near real-time updates.
        ETL Process:
            Extract – Pull from sources.
            Transform – Clean, remove duplicates, handle missing values.
            Load – Store in the warehouse.
    Step 5 – Data Modeling
        Choose schema for organizing data:
            Star Schema – Fact table + dimension tables (simpler).
            Snowflake Schema – Normalized dimensions (more detailed).
            Fact tables → numeric data (sales, quantity).
            Dimension tables → descriptive data (date, location).
    Step 6 – Data Loading & Testing
        Initial Load – Fill the warehouse with existing data.
        Incremental Load – Add only new/updated data regularly.
        Test for data accuracy, speed, and reliability.
    Step 7 – Maintain Data Quality & Governance
        Set data quality standards (accuracy, completeness)
        Implement validation & cleaning rules.
        Assign data ownership and control access.
        Regularly audit and review the system.


3. Three-Tier Data Warehouse Architecture
    Bottom Tier – Data Warehouse Server
        Main storage layer for integrated, historical, and current data.
        Can be relational (RDBMS) or multidimensional (MDDB).
        Data arrives here after ETL.
    Middle Tier – OLAP Server
        Connects data storage to user tools.
        Handles queries, aggregation, and analysis.
        Types:
            ROLAP – Works with relational databases via SQL.
            MOLAP – Uses multidimensional cubes for faster access.
            HOLAP – Mix of ROLAP + MOLAP.
    Top Tier – Front-End Tools
        Interface for reports, dashboards, and queries.
        Examples: Power BI, Tableau, Excel (OLAP mode).
        Business users explore data without deep technical knowledge using Top Tier.


4. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
    OLAP is a technology used to analyze large volumes of data quickly.
    It organizes data into multiple dimensions so it can be viewed from different angles.
    Mostly used with data warehouses for decision-making.
    Supports complex queries like comparisons, trends, and summaries.
    Fast response for large queries.
    Easy to compare data from different perspectives.
    Helps in finding hidden patterns and trends.
    Types of OLAP:
        ROLAP – Works on relational databases using SQL queries.
        MOLAP – Uses multidimensional data cubes for fast analysis.
        HOLAP – Combines ROLAP and MOLAP features.
    OLAP Operations are:
        Roll-up – Summarizing data (e.g., month → year).
        Drill-down – Going from summary to details (year → month → day).
        Slice – Looking at data for one dimension (sales in 2024).
        Dice – Selecting data for multiple dimensions (product A, region X, 2024).
        Pivot – Rotating data view for better understanding.
        

5. OLAP Queries
    Queries that are designed for analysis and reporting.
    Work on historical and summarized data, not on live transactions.
    Often use aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT.
    Can show data by different dimensions such as time, location, and product.
    Examples:
        Total sales by region and product category in 2024.
        Top 10 customers by purchase amount in the last year.
        Quarterly revenue comparison for 2022 and 2023.
    Query Languages Used:
        SQL – For relational OLAP queries.
        MDX – For multidimensional OLAP cube queries.
    Advantages:
        Quicker than normal SQL on large datasets.
        Allows interactive analysis without affecting operational systems.



6.Metadata Repository
