Question 1: A company has 3 types of products: A, B, and C.
            30% of products are type A, 50% are type B, 20% are type C.
            Defective rates for each type:
                Type A: 1% defective
                Type B: 2% defective
                Type C: 3% defective
            If a randomly selected product is defective, what is the probability that it is type B?

    Solution:
            Step 1: Define Events
                    Let A = Product is type A
                    Let B = Product is type B
                    Let C = Product is type C
                    Let D = Product is defective

                    We need: P(B|D)

            Step 2: Write Bayes Formula
                    P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

            Step 3: Total probability of defect
                    P(D) = P(D|A)*P(A) + P(D|B)*P(B) + P(D|C)*P(C)

                    Given:
                        P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.5, P(C) = 0.2
                        P(D|A) = 0.01, P(D|B) = 0.02, P(D|C) = 0.03

                    Calculate P(D):
                        P(D) = (0.01 * 0.3) + (0.02 * 0.5) + (0.03 * 0.2)
                        P(D) = 0.003 + 0.01 + 0.006
                        P(D) = 0.019

            Step 4: Apply Bayes Theorem
                    P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)
                    P(B|D) = (0.02 * 0.5) / 0.019
                    P(B|D) = 0.01 / 0.019
                    P(B|D) ≈ 0.526

        Answer: P(B|D) ≈ 0.526 or 52.6%


Question 2: A hospital has 2 types of patients: Male and Female.
            40% of patients are male, 60% are female.
            Probability of having a certain disease:
                Male: 5% have the disease
                Female: 2% have the disease
            If a randomly selected patient is found to have the disease, what is the probability that the patient is male?

    Solution:
            Step 1: Define Events
                    Let M = Patient is Male
                    Let F = Patient is Female
                    Let D = Patient has the disease

                    We need: P(M|D)

            Step 2: Write Bayes Formula
                    P(M|D) = (P(D|M) * P(M)) / P(D)

            Step 3: Total probability of disease
                    P(D) = P(D|M)*P(M) + P(D|F)*P(F)

                    Given:
                        P(M) = 0.4, P(F) = 0.6
                        P(D|M) = 0.05, P(D|F) = 0.02

                    Calculate P(D):
                        P(D) = (0.05 * 0.4) + (0.02 * 0.6)
                        P(D) = 0.02 + 0.012
                        P(D) = 0.032

            Step 4: Apply Bayes Theorem
                    P(M|D) = (P(D|M) * P(M)) / P(D)
                    P(M|D) = (0.05 * 0.4) / 0.032
                    P(M|D) = 0.02 / 0.032
                    P(M|D) ≈ 0.625

        Answer:  P(M|D) ≈ 0.625 or 62.5%
