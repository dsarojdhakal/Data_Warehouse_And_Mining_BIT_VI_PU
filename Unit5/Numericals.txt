Question 1: A company has 3 types of products: A, B, and C.
            30% of products are type A, 50% are type B, 20% are type C.
            Defective rates for each type:
                Type A: 1% defective
                Type B: 2% defective
                Type C: 3% defective
            If a randomly selected product is defective, what is the probability that it is type B?

    Solution:
            Step 1: Define Events
                    Let A = Product is type A
                    Let B = Product is type B
                    Let C = Product is type C
                    Let D = Product is defective

                    We need: P(B|D)

            Step 2: Write Bayes Formula
                    P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

            Step 3: Total probability of defect
                    P(D) = P(D|A)*P(A) + P(D|B)*P(B) + P(D|C)*P(C)

                    Given:
                        P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.5, P(C) = 0.2
                        P(D|A) = 0.01, P(D|B) = 0.02, P(D|C) = 0.03

                    Calculate P(D):
                        P(D) = (0.01 * 0.3) + (0.02 * 0.5) + (0.03 * 0.2)
                        P(D) = 0.003 + 0.01 + 0.006
                        P(D) = 0.019

            Step 4: Apply Bayes Theorem
                    P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)
                    P(B|D) = (0.02 * 0.5) / 0.019
                    P(B|D) = 0.01 / 0.019
                    P(B|D) ≈ 0.526

        Answer: P(B|D) ≈ 0.526 or 52.6%



Question 2: A hospital has 2 types of patients: Male and Female.
            40% of patients are male, 60% are female.
            Probability of having a certain disease:
                Male: 5% have the disease
                Female: 2% have the disease
            If a randomly selected patient is found to have the disease, what is the probability that the patient is male?

    Solution:
            Step 1: Define Events
                    Let M = Patient is Male
                    Let F = Patient is Female
                    Let D = Patient has the disease

                    We need: P(M|D)

            Step 2: Write Bayes Formula
                    P(M|D) = (P(D|M) * P(M)) / P(D)

            Step 3: Total probability of disease
                    P(D) = P(D|M)*P(M) + P(D|F)*P(F)

                    Given:
                        P(M) = 0.4, P(F) = 0.6
                        P(D|M) = 0.05, P(D|F) = 0.02

                    Calculate P(D):
                        P(D) = (0.05 * 0.4) + (0.02 * 0.6)
                        P(D) = 0.02 + 0.012
                        P(D) = 0.032

            Step 4: Apply Bayes Theorem
                    P(M|D) = (P(D|M) * P(M)) / P(D)
                    P(M|D) = (0.05 * 0.4) / 0.032
                    P(M|D) = 0.02 / 0.032
                    P(M|D) ≈ 0.625

        Answer:  P(M|D) ≈ 0.625 or 62.5%




Question 3: A data analyst wants to classify a new data point using the K-Nearest 
                Neighbour (K-NN) classification method. The dataset contains the following records:

                Record   X   Y   Class
                R1       2   4    A
                R2       4   2    A
                R3       4   4    B
                R4       6   4    B

                The new data point to classify is: P = (5, 3)
                        1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between point P and all training records.
                        2. Consider K = 3. Select the 3 nearest neighbors.
                        3. Determine the class of point P using majority voting.
                        4. Write the final classification result.

        Solution:

                Step 1: Calculate Euclidean Distance
                        Formula: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

                        Distance from P to R1 (2,4):
                              d = sqrt((5 - 2)^2 + (3 - 4)^2)
                                = sqrt(3^2 + (-1)^2)
                                = sqrt(9 + 1)
                                = sqrt(10)
                                Distance ≈ 3.16

                        Distance from P to R2 (4,2):
                              d = sqrt((5 - 4)^2 + (3 - 2)^2)
                                = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2)
                                = sqrt(2)
                                Distance ≈ 1.41

                        Distance from P to R3 (4,4):
                              d = sqrt((5 - 4)^2 + (3 - 4)^2)
                                = sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2)
                                = sqrt(2)
                                Distance ≈ 1.41

                        Distance from P to R4 (6,4):
                              d = sqrt((5 - 6)^2 + (3 - 4)^2)
                                = sqrt((-1)^2 + (-1)^2)
                                = sqrt(2)
                                Distance ≈ 1.41

                Step 2: Choose K = 3 Nearest Neighbors
                        Distances:
                                R1 = 3.16 (A)
                                R2 = 1.41 (A)
                                R3 = 1.41 (B)
                                R4 = 1.41 (B)

                        Sorted (smallest distance first):
                                1. R2 (A)
                                2. R3 (B)
                                3. R4 (B)

                        These are the 3 nearest neighbors.

                Step 3: Majority Voting
                        A: 1
                        B: 2
                        Majority class = B

                Step 4: Final Classification
                        The new point P = (5, 3) belongs to: Class B
