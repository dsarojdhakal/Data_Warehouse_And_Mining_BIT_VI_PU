Unit 5: Classification and Prediction(9)


a. What is Classification

    It is a process of assigning data items in a database to predefined classes
    Predicts class of new or unknown records in a dataset
    Assigns data items to predefined classes or groups.
    Predicts the category of new or unknown records.
    Learns from historical data to predict categories for new cases.
    A supervised data mining method (learns from known examples).
    Uses attributes/features of records for classification.
    Examples:
        Bank → Customer risk: High / Medium / Low
        Retail → Customer response: Yes / No
        Medical → Disease: Present / Absent
    Applications:
        Fraud detection: Identify suspicious transactions from past patterns
        Medical diagnosis: Detect diseases using patient records
        Customer segmentation: Group customers for marketing or recommendations



b. What is Prediction

    - Prediction is the process of forecasting a continuous numeric value for new or unknown records.
    - Estimates the likely outcome based on patterns learned from historical data.
    - It is a supervised data mining technique (like classification) but predicts numeric values instead of categories.
    - Uses attributes/features of records for prediction.
    - Examples:
        Bank → Predict customer’s future balance
        Retail → Estimate sales for next month
        Healthcare → Predict patient’s blood pressure or risk score
    - Applications:
        Stock market forecasting
        Weather prediction
        Sales estimation
        Risk assessment in finance and insurance



c. Issues Regarding Classification and Prediction

    Data may be incomplete, wrong, or messy
    It is hard to choose which features are important
    Model may fit training data too much and fail on new data (overfitting)
    Model may be too simple and miss patterns (underfitting)
    Some classes may have very few examples, causing bias
    Large data makes processing slow and difficult
    It is difficult to check if the model is really accurate
    Model may need changes when new data comes


d. Classification by Decision Tree Induction

    - Decision Tree is a tree-like model used to classify data into predefined classes.
    - Each internal node represents a test on an attribute.
    - Each branch represents an outcome of the test.
    - Each leaf node represents a class label (decision).
    - It is easy to understand and interpret.
    - It handles both numeric and categorical data.

    - Steps to build a decision tree:
        1. Select the best attribute using a measure like Information Gain or Gini Index.
        2. Split the dataset based on attribute values of the selected attribute.
        3. Repeat the process recursively for each branch using the remaining attributes.
        4. Stop recursion when:
            - All data in a branch belong to the same class, or
            - No remaining attributes, or
            - Predefined stopping criteria are met.
        5. Assign class labels to the leaf nodes.
