Unit 5: Classification and Prediction(9)


a. What is Classification

    It is a process of assigning data items in a database to predefined classes
    Predicts class of new or unknown records in a dataset
    Supervised data mining technique is used
    Uses attributes/features of records for classification
    Examples in data mining:
        Bank database → Customer risk: High / Medium / Low
        Retail database → Customer response: Yes / No
        Medical database → Disease: Present / Absent

    Applications of classification in :
        Fraud detection: Identify suspicious transactions from historical patterns
        Medical diagnosis: Detect diseases using patient records
        Customer segmentation: Group customers for targeted marketing



b. What is Prediction

    It is a process of estimating a numeric or continuous value for new data based on existing data
    Uses historical data to build a predictive model
    Predicts unknown or future values of attributes in a dataset
    Supervised data mining technique
    Uses features/attributes of records for prediction
    Examples in data mining:
        Predicting future sales of a product
        Estimating temperature or rainfall
        Forecasting stock prices



c. Issues Regarding Classification and Prediction

    Data may be incomplete, wrong, or messy
    It is hard to choose which features are important
    Model may fit training data too much and fail on new data (overfitting)
    Model may be too simple and miss patterns (underfitting)
    Some classes may have very few examples, causing bias
    Large data makes processing slow and difficult
    It is difficult to check if the model is really accurate
    Model may need changes when new data comes
